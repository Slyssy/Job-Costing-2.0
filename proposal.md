**Project Management Job Costing Visuals**

**Problem:**

Smaller Construction management teams have less resources and time to keep up with their busy days. Other than managing the team and projects they need to focus on the financial timelines and discussing projects with Stakeholders. Today's Project Management tools are designed for the Software Development teams that are usually inside offices, home office and coffee shops making it easier for them to access daily and update. Team Green is taking that idea but making it easier for the construction site, in truck and on the road lifestyle.

**Solution:**

Team Green's app will make user experience with project management tool friendlier and allows them to give live updates to their customers, clients, bosses.

Our app will allow for the leads to see progress in the financial and day to day workload. We are limiting the back and forth of chasing employees around for timesheets and daily progress.

With our team's experience we plan to bring the best, newest product to the table. The tools we will be using to create the app will include the following: Python, SQL Alchemy, Flask, Jinja templating, HTML/CSS, PostgreSQL, Plot.ly or D3 for Data Visualizations.

Our deliverable will be an app that can be accessed through computers, touch pads and cell phones. We will be focusing on a project dashboard route that includes aggregated critical project detail. Each project's financials can be accessed through the dashboard. A series of financial calculations will be made to assess the project's current financial status (e.g. whether it is under or over budget, or a change order is needed). Other routes will include the ability to update timesheets for employees which will get pulled into the financials area of the project detail.

We will measure our success based on Stephen(our primary stakeholder/project manager's) ability to use the product at work.
