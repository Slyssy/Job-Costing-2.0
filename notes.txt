Created app copy.py --- back up to review changes made
Need to refactor code -- use sqlalchemy 
    -- starting with new user route and then login route
Figure out hashing once sqlalchemy works

In ddSort branch:
- updated SQL query for new_time route to sort the User name and project names 
alphabetical order (ascending)
