        <h1>Green Team's Job Costing App</h1>
        <h4>Project Management Job Costing Visuals</h4>
        <p class="lead">
          Smaller Construction management teams have less resources and time to
          keep up with their busy days. Other than managing the team and
          projects, they need to focus on the financial timelines and discussing
          projects with Stakeholders.
          <br /><br />
          Team Green's app will make user experience with project management
          tool friendlier, and allows them to give live updates to their
          customers, clients, and bosses.
          <br />
          <br />
          This app will allow for the leads to see progress in the financial and
          day to day workload by tracking and visualizing budgeted labor values,
          and comparing them to the actual labor values. We are limiting the
          back and forth of chasing employees around for timesheets and daily
          progress. Knowing when a project is exceding budgeted time is often
          the first step to preventing a project from becoming a major loss.
